# SS1NET.ZIP

This archive contains the unzipped contents of the SS1NET archive. The SS1NET archive is a collection of files that describe the makeup of the ASIC used on the first version of the Konix Hardware (The one AOTMC was built against). These were used to produce the Verilog code that is used in the MiSTer FPGA version of the hardware. There is a Tool "KonixToVerilog", that can be used to convert the files into their verilog equivalent.
